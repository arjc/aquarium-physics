# Matter Js aquarium
An aquarium website, which I got inspired by google labs front page. 

## UsesMatter.js (cdn) for physics. 

[plans for future]==>
I want to make it similar to a "water bubble pusher toy" that I had when I was 10 (idk how to explain it.. it had rings and shit lol). 

It will only make sense if it was 3d, but I have a better aproach using2d
